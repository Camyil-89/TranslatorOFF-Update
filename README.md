## Translators

| Translator Name | Speed of Work | Translation Accuracy | Description |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
|DeepL|High|High|95% of the tests of the application were conducted with the translator DeepL, it seemed to me the fastest and most accurate of all. |
|Google|Medium|Medium|Often you are required to verify that you are not a robot. Such a feature as highlighting the last sentence does not work correctly.|
|Papago|Medium|Medium|I hardly ever used Papago.|

> Personally, I like DeepL best, it's quite fast and accurate in translation, especially if you use the translation history.
